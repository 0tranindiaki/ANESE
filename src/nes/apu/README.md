APUs are hard to get right.
And I want to play Super Mario Bros 2 (game of the year for... I don't know how
many years now!) with sound before new years.

As such, i'm copping out, and using Blargg's venerable nes_snd_emu library for the APU, instead of this stub I wrote (found in the `my_apu` folder).

That said, I am still going to write my own APU implementation!
Just not right now!

I am just going to do it later, once i've polished up the rest of the code
_\*cough\*_ INTERRUPT TIMING _\*cough\*_ and implemented some more Mappers.
