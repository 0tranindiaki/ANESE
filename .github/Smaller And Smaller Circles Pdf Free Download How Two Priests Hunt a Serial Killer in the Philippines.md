## A Brief Summary of Smaller and Smaller Circles by F.H. Batacan
 
If you are curious about what Smaller and Smaller Circles by F.H. Batacan is about, here is a brief summary of the plot. Beware of spoilers!
 
The story takes place in the summer of 1997, in Quezon City, a district of Manila. The main characters are Father Gus Saenz and Father Jerome Lucero, two Jesuit priests who are also forensic anthropologists. They are called by the Director of the National Bureau of Investigations to help with a series of murders that have been occurring in Payatas, a 50-acre dump site that is home to thousands of scavengers.
 
The victims are all teenage boys who have been mutilated and eviscerated, with their faces and genitals removed. The killer leaves behind a circular pattern of cigarette burns on their skin, hence the title of the book. The priests use their scientific and religious expertise to analyze the evidence and profile the killer, while also dealing with the challenges and dangers of working in such a hostile environment.
 
As they get closer to the truth, they discover that the killer is not only a psychopath, but also a product of a corrupt and abusive system that exploits and neglects the poor and vulnerable. They also face opposition from some powerful figures in the church and the government, who want to cover up the scandal and silence the priests.
 
Will the priests be able to catch the killer and bring justice to the victims? Will they be able to expose the corruption and injustice that plague their society? Will they be able to protect their faith and their flock from harm? These are some of the questions that Smaller and Smaller Circles by F.H. Batacan explores in this riveting and thought-provoking novel.
