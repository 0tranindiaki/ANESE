# How to Download and Install OrcaFlex 9.3
 
OrcaFlex is a powerful software for modelling and analysing marine systems, such as moorings, risers, pipelines, towed systems and more. It can perform static and dynamic simulations, as well as fatigue and extreme value analysis. If you want to download and install OrcaFlex 9.3 on your computer, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
**Download Zip ✫✫✫ [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbltlly.com%2F2uHvwm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3ZXFSXCR4rEH24klgD3SfY](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbltlly.com%2F2uHvwm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3ZXFSXCR4rEH24klgD3SfY)**


 
1. Visit the [OrcaFlex download page](https://www.orcina.com/support/download/) and download the OrcaFlex installer and your licence files[^1^]. You will need a zip file and possibly some licence files with the extension .lic.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a temporary location, and save the licence files (if you have them) to the same folder.
3. Run the extracted file Setup.exe to begin the installation. You will need to install from an account with administrator privileges.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You can choose the destination folder and whether to create shortcuts on your desktop or start menu.
5. Licence your copy of OrcaFlex by either activating a FlexNet licence or installing an OrcaFlex dongle, either of which will be supplied by Orcina or your Orcina agent. For more details on how to do this, see the file Installation Guide.pdf in (or extracted from) the zip file.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed OrcaFlex 9.3 on your computer. You can now start using it to model and analyse your marine systems.
 
## Hardware and Software Requirements for OrcaFlex 9.3
 
Before you download and install OrcaFlex 9.3, you should make sure that your computer meets the minimum hardware and software requirements for running the program. Here are some of the requirements you should check:

- You need Windows 8.1, 10 or 11 to run OrcaFlex 9.3. Both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows are supported[^2^].
- You need a screen resolution of at least 1280Ã768 if you are using small fonts (96dpi) or at least 1680Ã1050 if you are using large fonts (120dpi). However, we recommend a screen resolution of 1920Ã1080 or greater for better user experience[^2^].
- You need a DirectX 9 compatible graphics card with at least 256MB memory for the most effective use of the shaded graphics facility[^2^].
- You need Microsoft Excel (Excel 2010, or later) in order to use the OrcaFlex automation facilities. Both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Excel are supported although we strongly recommend the 64 bit version to avoid the severe constraints on memory usage of the 32 bit version[^2^].
- You need a powerful processor with fast floating point and memory performance. This is the most important factor since OrcaFlex is a computation-intensive program and simulation run times can be long for complex models[^2^].
- You need at least 4GB of memory. This is less important than processor performance but OrcaFlex does perform better in some respects when more memory is available, especially on multi-core systems[^2^].
- You need a multi-core system to take advantage of OrcaFlex's multithreading capabilities[^2^].
- You need as much disk space as you require to store simulation files. Simulation files vary in size, but can be hundreds of megabytes each for complex models[^2^].

If you have any difficulty downloading, installing or running OrcaFlex 9.3, please contact Orcina or your Orcina agent for support.
